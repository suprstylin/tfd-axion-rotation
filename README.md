TFD Axion Operational Area Rotation

Hello Descendants,

i created a little website that will show the current "Axion Operational Area Rotation" for the selected timezone. It can also export the schedule as an image. AX Power missions are highlighted in red since it is the fastest farm. The active missions are highlighted in green. On smartphones the mission names are shorter so they still fit. But you can rotate the screen or export the schedule as image if it is too small.

Please report issues and i will try to fix it. That's it, hope you like...

Happy Superconductive Cooling Unit farming!
